## Overview
This repository contains Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) focused projects designed to simulate realistic organizational security, risk, and compliance scenarios.

The projects emphasize structured security thinking, risk-based decision making, and alignment with recognized governance and compliance frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO/IEC, and industry best practices.

- Security governance and oversight
- Risk identification and assessment
- Compliance gaps and control evaluation
- Policy-driven security decision making
- Documentation and audit-style reporting

This repository complements technical cybersecurity projects by highlighting strategic, regulatory, and organizational security awareness.
