## Risk Context

Botium Toys currently faces a high overall risk level due to limited asset visibility, excessive user access privileges, lack of encryption, and insufficient security monitoring and recovery capabilities. These factors increase the likelihood of data breaches, regulatory penalties, and business disruption.

This audit serves as a foundational step toward improving governance, risk management, and compliance across the organization.
