# Risk Context

Botium Toys operates in a high-risk security environment due to limited visibility into its assets, weak access controls, and insufficient protection of sensitive data. The organization handles valuable assets and sensitive information, including customer personal data (PII), sensitive personal information (SPII), and payment card data, which significantly increases its risk exposure.

The overall risk level of the organization is assessed as high (8 out of 10). One of the primary risk factors is the lack of proper asset classification and inventory, which makes it difficult to apply appropriate security controls and prioritize protection efforts.

Botium Toys also faces serious access control issues. Non-privileged employees currently have access to sensitive customer and financial data, which violates the principle of least privilege and increases the likelihood of data breaches and compliance violations, particularly with standards such as PCI DSS.

Additionally, the organization does not consistently use encryption to protect sensitive data, lacks intrusion detection systems (IDS), and does not have a documented disaster recovery or backup strategy. These gaps increase the potential impact of security incidents, including data loss, regulatory penalties, operational downtime, and reputational damage.

Due to the company’s operations in both the United States and the European Union, failure to comply with applicable regulations such as GDPR and U.S. data protection laws further elevates legal and financial risks. Addressing these risks is critical to improving Botium Toys’ overall security posture and ensuring business continuity.
