# System Overview

## Organization Background
The organization under assessment is an e-commerce company that relies heavily on a centralized remote database server to support its business operations. The company has been operating for approximately three years and employs multiple staff members who work remotely from various locations.

The database server is a critical component of the organization’s infrastructure, as it stores operational and customer-related data required for daily business activities.

## System Description
The system consists of a remote database server that allows users to query and retrieve data. Since the company’s launch, the database server has been configured with public access, meaning it can be queried without strict access restrictions or authentication controls.

Both employees and external users are able to submit data requests to the server, which significantly increases the system’s exposure to potential security risks.

## Data Sensitivity
The database contains sensitive information, including but not limited to:
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) related to customers
- Business and operational data critical to the organization
- Data accessed regularly by remote employees

Due to the nature of e-commerce operations, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data are essential to maintaining trust and business continuity.

## System Importance to Business Operations
The database server serves as a core system for the organization. Any disruption, misuse, or compromise of this system could:
- Impact employee productivity
- Disrupt business operations
- Lead to potential data exposure or misuse
- Affect the organization’s reputation and customer trust

Because the company operates primarily in a digital environment, the availability and security of this system directly affect its overall performance and sustainability.

## Security Concern Overview
Allowing unrestricted public access to a database containing sensitive data introduces significant security concerns. The lack of access control, authentication, and monitoring mechanisms increases the likelihood of unauthorized access, data misuse, and potential exploitation of the system.
