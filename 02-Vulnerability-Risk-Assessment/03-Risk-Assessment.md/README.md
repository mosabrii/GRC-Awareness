# Risk Assessment

## Overview
This document provides a structured risk assessment for the identified security issues related to the organization’s database system.  
The assessment focuses on evaluating the likelihood, impact, and priority of risks affecting sensitive business and customer data.

---

## Risk Summary
The organization operates a public-facing database that has been accessible without proper access restrictions since the company was established.  
This exposure creates significant security risks due to the sensitive nature of the data stored and the wide range of users who can access the system.

---

## Identified Risk: Unauthorized Database Access

### Risk Description
Unauthorized access to the database by internal employees, remote workers, or external individuals poses a serious threat to the organization.  
Because access is broadly available, sensitive customer and business data can be viewed, copied, or misused without proper oversight.

---

### Threat Sources
- Internal employees with unrestricted access  
- Remote employees operating outside controlled environments  
- External unauthorized individuals with public access to the database  

These threat sources increase overall exposure due to the lack of access control, monitoring, and accountability.

---

### Likelihood
**Likelihood Level: Medium to High**

The probability of this risk occurring is elevated due to:
- The database being publicly accessible  
- Employees and external users having broad query privileges  
- A distributed workforce with remote access  
- Absence of enforced access restrictions or monitoring controls  

---

### Impact
**Impact Level: High**

If this risk is exploited, potential consequences include:
- Exposure of sensitive customer data (PII and SPII)  
- Legal penalties and regulatory fines  
- Reputational damage and loss of customer trust  
- Financial losses and operational disruption  

Given the nature of the stored data, regulatory compliance requirements such as PCI-related obligations significantly increase the severity of impact.

---

### Risk Priority
**Overall Risk Level: High – Critical Priority**

This risk represents a major threat to business continuity, legal compliance, and organizational reputation.  
Immediate attention and mitigation planning are required to reduce exposure and prevent potential data breaches.

## Notes
This risk assessment focuses solely on identifying and evaluating risk severity.  
Mitigation strategies, security controls, and corrective actions are documented separately.
