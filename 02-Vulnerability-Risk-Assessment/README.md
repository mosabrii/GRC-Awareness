# Vulnerability and Risk Assessment – E-commerce Database Exposure

## Project Overview
This project presents a structured vulnerability and risk assessment for a small e-commerce company operating a publicly accessible database server.  
The assessment focuses on identifying security risks associated with unrestricted access to sensitive customer and business data, and proposing remediation strategies aligned with industry-recognized standards.

The project is based on the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** framework and emphasizes **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** principles to support risk-informed decision-making.

## Scenario Description
A small e-commerce company stores critical business data and **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** on a remote database server.  
For the past three years, the server has been publicly accessible to support a globally distributed, remote workforce.

As a cybersecurity analyst, you identified that exposing the database server to the public internet presents a **critical security vulnerability**.  
This assessment evaluates the potential for data breaches, unauthorized access, service disruption, and their impact on business continuity and regulatory compliance.

## Methodology
This project applies a **qualitative risk assessment methodology** based on:

- **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** (Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments)
- Likelihood × Impact risk scoring model
- Application of core security principles such as:
  - Least Privilege
  - Defense in Depth

The analysis prioritizes business impact and risk severity rather than technical exploitation.

## Repository Structure
To ensure clarity and professional documentation, this project is organized into the following files:

- `01-System-Overview.md`  
  Provides an overview of the system, including business purpose, data types, users, and overall importance to the organization.

- `02-Threat-Sources.md`  
  Identifies internal, external, and technical threat sources that could exploit the exposed database server.

- `03-Risk-Assessment.md`  
  Evaluates identified threats based on likelihood and impact, and assigns overall risk severity to support prioritization.

- `04-Remediation-Strategy.md`  
  Proposes prioritized remediation and mitigation strategies aligned with security frameworks and best practices.
