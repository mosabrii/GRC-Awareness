# Vulnerability & Risk Assessment – Small Business Database Server

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world vulnerability and risk assessment conducted for a small e-commerce company.  
The assessment focuses on identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing security risks affecting a publicly accessible database server that stores sensitive business and customer data.

The project is aligned with the NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment framework and demonstrates structured, risk-based security analysis rather than hands-on exploitation.

## Scenario
A small e-commerce company stores its customer and business data on a remote database server.  
The server has been publicly accessible since the company launched and is frequently queried by employees working remotely from different geographic locations.

As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst, you identified that exposing the database server to the public internet presents a critical security vulnerability.  
Management has requested a formal vulnerability and risk assessment to understand potential threats, business impact, and remediation options.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Assess security risks associated with a publicly exposed database server
- Identify potential threat sources and threat events
- Evaluate risks based on likelihood and impact
- Propose security controls to mitigate or reduce identified risks

This assessment is intended to support risk-informed decision making by non-technical stakeholders.

---

## Scope
The scope of this assessment includes:
- The database server and its exposure to external networks
- Risks affecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Logical and administrative security controls

The following are **out of scope**:
- Physical security of infrastructure
- Penetration testing or exploitation activities
- Detailed system configuration reviews

---

## Methodology
This project follows a **qualitative risk assessment approach** based on:
- NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1
- Risk-based security analysis
- Likelihood × Impact risk scoring

Threat sources, threat events, and risks are identified and evaluated using professional judgment and industry best practices.

---

## Deliverables
The project produces the following documentation:
- System overview and assessment scope
- Risk assessment table with likelihood, impact, and risk scores
- Methodology explanation for risk prioritization
- Remediation and mitigation strategy aligned with security frameworks

Each section is documented in separate files for clarity and maintainability.
