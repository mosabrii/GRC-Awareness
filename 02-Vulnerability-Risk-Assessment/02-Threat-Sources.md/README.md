# Threat Sources

This section identifies the primary sources of threats affecting the organization’s database system, based on the business context and operating environment.

## Overview
The organization handles highly sensitive data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and sensitive business-related information. Due to the open access model of the database and the lack of strict access controls, the system is exposed to significant internal and external threats.

## Internal Threat Sources
Employees represent a major threat source due to their level of access to the database system. Since employees can query and retrieve data without strict authorization controls, there is a risk of intentional or unintentional misuse of sensitive information.

Potential internal threats include:
- Misuse of customer data for personal gain
- Unauthorized sharing of sensitive information with competitors
- Leakage of confidential data such as addresses, financial details, or business records
- Abuse of access privileges due to insufficient monitoring and oversight

The risk is further increased because some employees work remotely, which reduces visibility and control over how and where the system is accessed.

## External Threat Sources
External individuals pose an even greater risk because they are not bound by organizational policies, contracts, or internal monitoring mechanisms. The database being publicly accessible allows external actors to directly interact with sensitive data.

Potential external threats include:
- Data theft for financial or criminal purposes
- Selling sensitive information on underground or illegal markets
- Exploiting the open access to extract large volumes of data
- Unauthorized access without accountability or traceability

## Technical Threat Sources
Technical threats also exist due to weak system design and security controls. The absence of proper authentication, authorization, and monitoring mechanisms increases the likelihood of system abuse.

These threats arise from:
- Lack of access restrictions on the database
- Insufficient logging and monitoring
- Inadequate security controls for remote access
- Poor segregation between internal and external users

## Threat Classification Summary
The identified threat sources can be classified as:
- Internal human threats
- External human threats
- Technical and system-based threats
