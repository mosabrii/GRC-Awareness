# Remediation and Mitigation Plan

## Objective
The purpose of this remediation plan is to reduce the security risks identified during the vulnerability assessment of the publicly accessible database system.  
The recommendations focus on preventing unauthorized access, protecting sensitive data, and minimizing business impact in the event of a security incident.

---

## Immediate Remediation Actions
The following actions should be treated as high priority due to the critical nature of the exposed database:

- Restrict public access to the database by implementing network-level access controls.
- Require authentication and authorization for all database queries.
- Remove access permissions for external users who are not part of the organization.
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure employees can only access data required for their job functions.

---

## Security Control Improvements
To reduce the likelihood of future incidents, the organization should strengthen its security controls:

- Apply the principle of least privilege to all users, especially remote employees.
- Enable centralized logging and monitoring for all database access activities.
- Regularly review and audit user permissions to detect excessive or unused access.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for employees accessing sensitive systems.

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategy
Some risks cannot be fully eliminated, but their impact can be reduced through mitigation:

- Segment sensitive databases from public-facing systems.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to limit the impact of data exposure.
- Establish incident response procedures to quickly contain and respond to data breaches.
- Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify new threats as the organization grows.

---

## Business and Compliance Considerations
Failure to secure the database may result in:
- Regulatory penalties related to data protection laws.
- Loss of customer trust and reputational damage.
- Financial losses due to legal actions or service disruption.

Implementing the remediation measures outlined above supports compliance requirements and strengthens the organization’s overall security posture.

---

## Conclusion
By applying these remediation and mitigation measures, the organization can significantly reduce the risk associated with public database exposure.  
This plan emphasizes proactive security controls, risk-aware decision-making, and alignment with industry best practices.
